# Hackspace Foundation Resources
Curated resources to aid starting and running a Hackspace.

Organised by a number of trustees/directors of UK hackspaces, this repo contains reusable materials for starting or running a hackspace.  It complements the high level information available on the UK Hackspace Foundation website: http://www.hackspace.org.uk/

The majority of the content is arranged within the *[Hackspace Owners Manual](Hackspace%20Owners%20Manual/README.md)*, so start there :)
