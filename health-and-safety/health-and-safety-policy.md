# Sample Health and Safety Policy

This is an example Health and Safety Policy for a hackspace. You should use this policy as a template
for your own health and safety policy, and review it periodically.

## Introduction
This is the health and safety policy for *Name of Space*. It sets out our approach to health and
safety and your safety responsibilities when using the space.

This policy was last updated on *date* and should be reviewed before *review date*.

## Responsibilities

* The Directors/Trustees are responsible for creating a safe environment by identifying the risks and maintaining tools, equipment, and spaces in good working order
* Space users (members and visitors) must follow all safety guidelines, use equipment properly, and report hazards or unsafe conditions to the Directors/Trustees
* Everyone must take responsibility for their own safety and the safety of others while using the space

## Risk Assessment

Before any new tool or process is introduced, a risk assessment must be completed. The assessment should:

* Identify any risks involved in the activity
* Evaluate the likelihood and impact of harm
* Determine appropriate control measures to minimise the risk

This risk assessment should be completed by the Directors/Trustees and made available to space users. It must be reviewed regularly and updated when there are changes to activities, tools, or the environment.

Before using a tool or process, space users should familiarise themselves with the risks by reading the risk assessment
or other documentation provided.

##Â Training

The risk assessment may require training for some tools or processes. Space users must ensure they are correctly
trained before undertaking work with these.

## Personal Protective Equipment

Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used when necessary, particularly when using machinery, tools, or handling hazardous materials. 

The Directors/Trustees must ensure PPE is available and that space users understand how to use it correctly.

## Incident Reporting

Space users must report all accidents, injuries, or near misses to the Directors/Trustees as soon as possible.

*Describe incident reporting process*

The Directors/Trustees must keep a record of incidents, and ensure any serious incidents are investigated to prevent recurrence.

The Directors/Trustees should report serious incidents and near misses to the UK Hackspace Foundation incident reporting system, to allow trends and risks to be identified.
