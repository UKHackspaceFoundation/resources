# Preface

The Hackspace Foundation is established to aid in the growth of the maker
and hacking community by working with groups to develop and aid spaces
that are inclusive, democratic, and STEAM (Science Technology Engineering
Arts Mathematics) orientated.

The organisation is run by and for Hackspaces to help co-operate,
coordinate and promote Hackspaces and making in general.

# Introduction - The Hackspace Owners Manual

The Hackspace Owners Manual (HOM) is intended to be a wide surface
coverage of anything that you might need to know to run a hackspace from
starting up through accounting and even what kind of tooling you might
like to invest in.

Each chapter of the HOM attempts to summarise the information you need
whilst providing links to further reading resources and case studies of
implementations in the given area of discussion. HOM tries to give you the
facts of the area in a way that enables you to make informed decisions
that are right for your organisation.

For further information see the [The Hackspace Owners Manual](About%20this%20manual)
section of the manual.
