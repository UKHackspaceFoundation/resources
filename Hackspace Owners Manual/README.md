# Preface

The UK Hackspace Foundation is established to aid in the growth of the
maker and hacking community by working with groups to develop and aid
spaces that are inclusive, democratic, and STEAM (Science Technology
Engineering Arts Mathematics) orientated.

The organisation is run in conjunction with member Hackspaces to help Hackspaces to
co-operate, coordinate and promote Hackspaces.
