# Introduction - The Hackspace Owners Manual

The Hackspace Owners Manual (HoM) is intendended to be a wide surface
coverage of anything that you might need to know to run a hackspace from
starting up through accounting and even what kind of tooling you might
like to invest in.

Each chapter of the HoM attempts to summarise the information you need
whilst providing links to further reading resources and case studies of
implementations in the given area of discussion. HoM tries to give you the
facts of the area in a way that enables you to make informed decisions
that are right for your organisation.
