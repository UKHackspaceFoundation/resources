# Introduction

A laser cutter emits high powered light in order to cut or engrave a target material. Power levels can vary from very small at around or less than 1w through to extremely large at several kw.

This document aims to summarise the hardware options available in considering purchase and maintenance of machines less than 200w as these are the machines most commonly found in hackspaces.

# Machine Beds

One of the biggest factor in determining cost of a machine is the size of bed you wish to work with. Machines can come in any size but it's common to find sizes roughly matching ISO A series paper sizes:

| Designation | ISO Size | Laser bed size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A0 | 841 x 1189 mm | 900 x 1200mm |
| A1 | 594 x 841 mm | 600 x 900mm |
| A2 | 420 x 594 mm | 400 x 600mm |
| A3 | 297 x 420 mm | 300 x 400mm |
| A4 | 210 x 297 mm | 200 x 300mm |

Machines are sometimes referred to by their rough ISO A series paper size and sometimes as a "6040" or "4060" meaning 600 x 400mm. Be sure you understand the size of the work you expect to cut vs the stated bed size. Beds are normally wider than they are deep. If you're going down the route of building your own machine, you can of course make this any size you want.

When engraving material, the physical bed of our machine does not impact the quality of your results other than potentially depositing resin onto the rear of your piece from previous work. Cutting on the other hand is greatl;y affected by the underlying bed. Each contact with the bed below the work results in reflections that can mark the rear of your work, so it's best to try and minimise these as much as possible.

## Knife or Blade

Knife beds minimise contact with the work by providing minimal support in the form of vertical knives that the work rests upon. Other than the very top of the knife edge, all edges are angled away from the resting work surface minimising reflections back onto the work above.

The down side of a knife bed is that it can only be used for larger work pieces. Smaller items will drop between the blades when cut through which could then interfere with other cuts or engrave operations.

## Honeycomb

The honeycomb bed design attempts to minimise the contact whilst still providing support to small work. Thin pieces of metal are interlocked to create the structure resulting in the edge of these pieces being in contact and providing a reflection back to the work.

In some cases it may be possible to counteract the flashback by placing paper based masking tape on the rear of the work so that it may absorb the reflections and protect the work. For acrylic, simply leave the protective coating on both sides whilst cutting. When cutting is complete, remove the tape and associated flashback markings.

## Pass through bed

Some machines feature removable panels in the front and rear of the case allowing larger pieces of work to be placed through the machine whilst the safety and integrity are maintained.

# Motion

Laser cutters are two axis CNC machines with the potential for three in the form of height adjustment. It is relatively uncommon to find machines with the Z axis height adjust controlled by software. In most lower cost machines this motion is provided by a small mains motor and directly switched mains from the control panel.

Additional capacity to work on cylindrical objects may be obtained by replacing one of the axis with a rotary bed.

## Rotary beds

Rotary beds are available in various forms including lathe style chuck or between centres, or via rollers onto which objects can be placed.

Only one of X and Y motion is required during use of a rotary bed - one axis is lined up parallel with your rotary bed path. The stepper driving the tagental path is disconnected and the stepper motor on the rotary bed connects to your stepper drivers instead in order to provide the rotary motion. Most machines have a larger X axis meaning the Y axis is usually the one disconnected to provide motion to the rotary bed.

As with all stepper drivers, take care not to disconnect the motor from a powered stepper driver or damage may result to the driver.

Be sure to calibrate your software for the change to the axis, your step distance is unlikely to be identical between the two different stepper motors.

With all rotary beds you run the risk of damaging your work piece through support rollers, chuck jaws or centre points. Consider this when mounting and either protect the work against this or leave yourself additional material that can be removed in finishing.

### Rollers

Roller style beds can consist of either rollers the full length of your work piece or rollers at either end of your work.

If engraving on to a wine glass, it could be difficult to place the glass onto full length rollers vs rollers only at the ends of the work. Independent rollers at either end of the work can provide greater flexibility in gripping irregularly shaped objects such as a wine glass.

Full width roller style is the cheapest solution to adding rotary motion.

### Chucks

Traditionally found on lathes, small chucks may be used to grip work at one end. Those found for rotary engraving are not usually of the same standard of precision you might find on a lathe as they are not required to spin at any speed. Variants can be found with conventional metal working jaws or more common to woodworking lathes with adjustable pins for differing sizes of work.

Conventional wisdom for metal turning would recommend that the protrusion from the chuck should be no more than three times that of the diameter, though that assumes a sideways force not present in this use case. Use your own judgement in determining if your work needs an additional support such as a live centre at the other end of the work to prevent it becoming off centre during the engrave resulting in non optimal focal length on opposite sides of the work.

### Between centres

Turning between centres is a common operation for both metal and woodworking through the use of a drive centre and either a live (rotating) or dead (stationary) centre at the opposite or tailstock end of the work.

This relatively simple form of drive can provide a high level of accuracy in turning operations but that is not a consideration for this case.

# Optical Path

In non LED laser machines, there are usually three mirrors to be found and a focusing lense.

Mirror number one is placed at the rear of the machine and reflects the beam from the tube into the body of the machine. Mirror two reflects the beam from the side of the machine along the gantry to the head. Mirror three sits at the top of the head and reflects the beam downwards to the lense and ultimately the work.

## Mirrors

The science behind optical reflectivity is deep and extensive. Mirrors are usually 20mm or 25mm diameter though are available in other diameters. Mirrors are made either from a solid piece of material or by applying a coating to another material.

Key indicators to note are optical reflectivity, divergence from perfectly flat and surface finish. Different materials, reflective coatings and protective coatings will also behave differently depending on the optical wavelength of your laser source.

Key performance indicators for mirrors are:

| Value | Unit | Notes | Guide value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reflectance | Percentage | Larger is better | &gt;= 99% |
| Surface flatness | Fractions of wavelength | Smaller is better | lambda/4 @ 1064 nm |
| Surface quality | scratch-dig | Smaller is better | 40-20 or less |

A protective coating applied to any mirror will prolong itâ€™s operating life and make damage less likely in the course of use and cleaning.

### K9 - Glass

K9 mirrors are glass with a gold coating on one face. A coating is applied to protect the gold from oxidation.

Due to the base material used, thermal conductivity is low resulting in all heat being dissipated in the reflective and protective coatings. They are not suitable for use with CO<sub>2</sub> lasers greater than 50w due to their lack of thermal mass.

These mirrors are cheap, low quality and fragile. They are also prone to overheating and the coating catching fire if the mirror is in any way dirty. Avoid this type of mirror.

### Si - Silicon Glass

Si mirrors are silicon infused glass with a gold coating on one face. A coating is applied to protect the gold from oxidation.

These mirrors are typically rated up to 150w for use with CO<sub>2</sub> lasers. These are recommended as the default for hobbyists operating home machines. A base material of glass makes these fragile.

### Mo - Molybdenum

Mo mirrors are molybdenum polished to a high finish, as a result these mirrors are silver in colour rather than the gold of all of the others discussed in this document.

There is usually no reflective or protective coatings on this material. It's extremely hard wearing and is recommended for hackspace or high use machines.

These mirrors appear to be rated up to 200W for use with CO<sub>2</sub> lasers.

### Cu - Copper

Cu mirrors are a solid copper base material with a gold coating on one face. A coating is applied to protect the gold from oxidation.

These mirrors are rated at a similar power level to Mo at 30-200W for CO<sub>2</sub> lasers. They are the best heat absorbing mirror for higher power optical paths however they typically have a lower reflectance and surface quality due to the softer base material.

The most expensive of the mirrors we have looked at here, they are liable to scratching if not maintained with great care.

### Comparison and recommendations

The following values are based on research of mirrors available via Aliexpress and other online vendors of mirrors. The figures may be inaccurate or misleading and you are encouraged to do your own research. Values supplied are typical for the mirrors found.

| Material | Reflectance | Flatness | Quality | Power | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K9 |  | &Lambda;/2 per 1" diameter @ 10.6&micro;m | 40-20 | 30w - 50w | Poor quality - don't use these |
| Si |  | &Lambda;/2 per 1" diameter @ 10.6&micro;m | 40-20 | Up to 200w | Ideal middle ground for home and hobby machines |
| Mo |  | &Lambda;/2 per 1" diameter @ 10.6&micro;m | 40-20 | Up to 200w | Hard wearing in tough environments - ideal for hackspace machines |
| Cu |  | &Lambda;/2 per 1" diameter @ 10.6&micro;m | 60-40 | Up to 200w | Ideal for higher power machines 120w or greater? |

## Head mounted

## Beam combiner

# Air assist

Air assist serves to clear smoke away from your cutting head as quickly as possible. This both keeps the smoke away from your lense reducing cleaning frequency but also clearing smoke in the optical path to the work preventing unpredictable changes in power due to attenuation.

There are two common approaches to providing the air supply to discuss.

## Linear Compressors

Attribution for image - taken from the old Just Add Sharks site - need to ask Dominic/Martin if itâ€™s okay to use it.

Flow rates? Does cutter size matter or is it about power levels?

## Beams

Lasers emit sometimes invisible optical radiation that can seriously damage your eyesight. Donâ€™t look directly into the beam or itâ€™s reflections.

## Materials

Be careful what you cut/etch. Not all materials are suitable and many can give off poisonous gasses when cut using a laser. If in doubt, make sure that you purchase laser safe supplies from a reputable supplier.

The London Hackspace has an excellent wiki article detailing how to [identify if an unknown material is safe to cut](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Silvertail_A0_Laser_Cutter#List_of_allowed_and_banned_materials)
