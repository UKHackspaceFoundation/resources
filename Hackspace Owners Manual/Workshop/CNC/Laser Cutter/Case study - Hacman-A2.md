# Introduction

The Manchester Hackspace (Hacman) had been using a K40 style laser cutter on loan for a number of years and it had become apparent that the size of the machine was no longer big enough to meet the needs of the members of the space and ongoing maintenance was becoming a headache. Research began, a budget was discussed and a suitable machine was identified as a potential solution.

## Specifications

The blue box laser cutter I have on loan to the space has been on its last legs for a while, and maintenance is becoming a total nightmare. It's time to replace it with a newer model.

Since we’re updating, we might as well get something bigger and better!  I’ve been looking into various options, and the best one for us seems to be a Chinese 6040 Laser Cutter, like the following:

* 600mm x 400mm bed size (4 times the area of our current laser).
* 50W tube, allowing us to cut thicker material, up to around 12mm deep.
* Air assist
* Red dot pointer
* HoneyComb Bed.
* Height-adjustable bed, to allow engraving on super thick materials (up to 250mm deep).
* Rotary axis for engraving on bottles and other round stuff!

I’ve recently been over to Leeds Hackspace, who have bought the 60W version of this laser cutter for their hackspace and wanted it upgraded with a LAOS board. The cutter seemed very well made, and came with all the bells and whistles I had to add myself to the old laser. Conversion to LAOS took around 5 hours total, and was up and running right away.

# Purchase

Hackspaces typically do not have the funds to purchase large tools such as a laser cutter outright and look to their members to fund such purchases. Based on the above information, members were invited to pledge money towards the purchase only needing to pay once the goal had been reached. In a Kickstarter style, stretch goals were set for different funding levels.

The new machine is henceforth known as the 'Orange Laser' to distinguish it from the existing K40 'Blue Laser'.

## Fund raising

The total for buying the laser cutter, and replacing the electronics with the LAOS board we currently use is £1600. Whatever you give will be matched with laser time on the new cutter - If you give £100 you’ll get £100 of credit automatically! I’m going to start the pledging off at £200 because i’m pretty cool like that.

Goals:

| £1600 | 50W 6040 Laser Cutter |
| £1900 | We can afford to up the anti and get the 60W version! This would allow faster cutting, and thicker materials. |
| £1950 | Upgraded (external) stepper drivers, will allow us to move the X and Y axes faster, allowing for significantly faster engraving. |
| £2100 | Build a wheely base, including an overhead gantry, raspberry pi b+ and pi cam to use visicut's awesome [camera positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VaI8r-8oNw) functionality. |

In total £2150 was raised in pledges allowing the purchase of the 60w machine and upgraded stepper drivers. Once pledges had been paid, we proceeded to ordering the machine.
