# The book of Paperwork

Paperwork exists and grows exponentially. Hopefully together we can grow the templates faster than the requirements.

## RAMS for events

If your space is attending an event you are likely to be asked for a Risk Assessment and Method Statement. Officially they should first provide you with the event's own RAMS but more than likely you will just be asked for yours.

If you have not received the organisers RAMS or site plans, note this in the "Show Specific Risks".

Please be aware under CDM Regulations, all public events and any event including children count as "High Risk".

The link below is more a RA (Risk Assessment) with some MS's (Method Statements).

It does need some maker additions adding (3d printers etc) but will cover all the basics as is. Import it into your preferred Spreadsheet program, edit and then print/export to pdf in Landscape.
