## General guidance##

Don't burn the place down.

## Signs##

official danger signs should be used for official dangers. This so if the firemen have to break in they are aware of dangers. These signs are white, black and red. The old versions (yellow and black) should be avoided an replaced.

A web form is proposed to help do clear signs. Readable and understandable be ESL and neurodiverse people.
