# Health and Safety

## General guidance

Don't burn the place down.

## Signs 

official danger signs should be used for official dangers. This so if the firemen have to break in they are aware of dangers. These signs are white, black and red. The old versions (yellow and black) should be avoided an replaced.

A web form is proposed to help do clear signs. Readable and understandable be ESL and neurodiverse people.

## Risk Assesment

### What is a Risk Assesment and why?

You check the possible ways (assess) in which a certain "bad thing" (risk) can happen. This is likelyhood, frequency and the amount of damage of said risk. 

Risk assesment is done to make sure people or equipment don't break or get hurt. If this still does not fit your moral compass it would still be good to do to make sure you comply with regulations.

#### Description of Project

Routine cloning‭ ‬and manipulation of harmless eukaryotic sequences in disabled‭ ‬E.‭ ‬coli K12‭ ‬strains using non-mobilisable and/or mobilisation-defective vectors,‭ ‬with no intention to express gene products.

#### Location of Work

The GM activity with take place in the London Hackspace biolab at 447 Hackney Road, London, E2 9DY

The laboratory work will be done at CL-1

There will be no animal work

#### Description of the project,‭ ‬including the methods to be used and the purpose of the genetic modification

This is a generic risk assessment for cloning harmless sequences from any eukaryotic organism into disabled‭ ‬E.‭ ‬coli K12‭ ‬hosts for the purpose of facilitating molecular biology procedures such as‭ (‬i‭) ‬sub-cloning,‭ ‬DNA sequencing,‭ ‬or site-directed mutagenesis‭; (‬ii‭) ‬construction of fusions with harmless reporter genes such as GFP‭; (‬iii‭) ‬construction of recombinant plasmids for subsequent transfection of eukaryotic cell lines‭; (‬iv‭) ‬construction of recombinant plasmids for subsequent transfection of defined packaging cell lines for the purpose of producing disabled recombinant viral vectors.‭ 
[‬Note:‭ ‬cloning any of the above types of excluded sequences will need to be covered by non-generic,‭ ‬specific risk assessments.‭]‬.
