Dear Members,

We need help to make the hackspace work well for everybody.

[Hackspace Name] is a community organisation. That means all the members are equal partners. We have a [board, trustees, directors]. This is [# number board members] people who do some admin jobs for [Hackspace Name]. The board makes sure the bills get paid on time. The [board, trustees, directors] makes sure that new members learn how to use the hackspace. The [board, trustees, directors] deals with any complaints from members.

All members need to help create a good working hackspace. Our hackspace always needs a lot of work so that everyone can use it. At the moment we need more people to do some of this work.

Here is a list of things that we need members to help with:

*    Accessibility. This means that we need people to say what they need to be able to use the space. We also need people who can explain what changes other people might need to be able to use the space. This could be changes for people in wheelchairs, people with seeing or hearing problems, people with assistance dogs or people with other disabilities that are not obvious. We want to make the space a good place that everyone can use.
*    Promotion. We need people who like using social media like [Social Media 1] and [Social Media 2] to do [Hackspace Name] posts. We need people to write blog posts about [Hackspace Name] events. We need people to run [Hackspace Name] stands at makerfaire and other events. We would like members to find places to talk about hackspaces and [Hackspace Name] so that more people find out us.
*    Infrastructure. This means the physical areas in the hackspace. If you can help make these areas ready to use or maintain, please help.
       * [Area 1] – if you want to help with this, please talk to [Contact 1]
       * [Area 2] –  Please talk to [Contact 2].
       * [Area 3] – Please talk to [Contact 3].
       * [Area 4] – Please talk to [Contact 4].
*    Documentation, Health & Safety. We have a lot of tools and equipment. We need help with training new members, and writing signs and instructions. Some of the tools and equipment can be dangerous. New members need to learn how to stay safe and have fun in the hackspace. We all need to know how to look after the tools and equipment properly. This will keep the tools and equipment in good condition. Please ask [Contact 5] if you can help with this.
*    [Other]: 
*    Volunteer: we always need people to help run stalls at events. We need people who are happy to talk about what they do at the hackspace. We also need people who can do demonstrations at events e.g. building a mini robot. We tell members about events on [Comms means 1].
*    Organise an event: [Procedure for events] If the event means that other members cannot use the hackspace at the same time, then other members must agree that this is okay.
*    “Hack the space” days. We want people to organise one-off days where members work together to improve the hackspace. This could be painting the walls, or building a bench, or organising storage, or making the hackspace easier for everyone to use.
 *   Run a workshop. We would love people to offer a one-off or regular session that is open to the public, as well as members. You can share a skill or interest with other people. You can ask other members for information about past workshops to get ideas.

Lastly, all members can help every time they are in the space. Please spend a few minutes tidying up. You can clear the tables and benches. You can sweep the floor or empty the bins or clean the toilet. It is very important that we keep the space clean and tidy for everyone to use. Please also make sure that nothing is left where people could trip over it, or it gets in the way. This will make the hackspace a safer and more fun place for all of us to use.
