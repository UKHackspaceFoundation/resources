# Summary

Once a space reaches a membership of more than around ten people, it
becomes impractical to maintain access via keys and duplication. The cost
is prohibitive and the security it provides decreases with each and every
duplicate set you have cut.

Access control enables your members to gain access to your space without
the need for a set of keys and enables revocation of expired members
access without the need to get keys back from that member.

Don't get carried away with your security concerns on the electronics and
network side when considering physical access control.

Locks of any kind will only protect you against honest people, most things
don't stand up well when hit with a large hammer or a determined
individual.

# Access Token Technologies

Cards or tokens for access can come in many different types of technology,
we'll cover a few here for reference.

## Magnetic stripe

Whilst mostly obsolete, magnetic track card readers are still fairly
common in many places with all UK bank cards still having this facility.

Unless you manage to obtain a low cost or free supply of readers and
cards, it's not worth investing in this technology at this point.

If you do choose this technology you will need to program your own cards
as using bank cards will reveal morew information to the reader than you
want to see. Limit your card numbers to 12 digits if you hope to have
any compatibility with commercial off the shelf solutions.

Due to the contact based nature, the card and reader will wear out and
require replacement.

Despite all of this, they are still commonly found in hotels worldwide.

## Contactless Tokens

Contactless tokens generally come in two frequencies:

* 125KHz
* 13.56MHz

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification

Most contactless tokens are available in multiple formats such as cards,
keyfobs or even stickers.

The main difference between the two main frequency standards is that of
range and amount of data.

The 125KHz tokens are generally longer range but only transmit a serial
number.

The 13.56MHz tokens are much shorter range (typically 10cm or less) but can
perform much more complex operations including levels of encryption and
security beyond those available at the lower frequency.

### MiFare 

MiFare is one of the defacto 13.56MHz contactless smart token standards and
is widely adopted. You may be familiar with it in one of the following:

* Oyster card
* Contactless bank payment cards
* University library or ID cards

## Other technologies

The following technologies are also available but were not discussed:

* Contact based smart cards
* Barcode or QR code

Generally these would not be considered suitable for controlling access.

# Locks

There are as many locking options as there are types of door for them to
installed upon, so whilst it's possible to give general advice every door
and circumstance is different.
