#Membership

##Associated organisations

Normally we consider a hackspace to [be X](define.md) but inclusion in the foundation is at the discretion of the directors and reasons will be given at the time of your application if it is rejected

##Removal of Membership

Membership is at all times subject to review. Should your organisational direction change you may no longer be eligible for your previously agreed membership. Membership will be evaluated annually to allow the foundation to react to changes in member organisations directions and directors.


#Directors

##Eligability

For someone to be eligible, they either need to be voted to be the space rep for the foundation for the year, or they need to be specifically proposed and accepted as an independent who we consider to be really valuable.

Directors are expected to allocate at least three hours per week to foundation duties, and must declare any conflicts of interest in their nomination statement. such conflicts of interest include; directorship of a member organisation, directorship of an organisation that supplies hackspaces, etc.

##Directors Membership

Directors, upon being voted in, gain individual membership for their time in office, conferring all the rights associated with such membership.
